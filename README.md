# AppDev Cloud Services Training

Welcome to AppDev training! We are excited that you chose to learn about cloud
services, and we hope you enjoy the training. Please read through these
instructions to get an idea of how this course works, and don't hesitate to
reach out to Zander if you are confused about anything.

## How This Training Works

This repository will serve as the website for the training. There is a section
(also called a branch) for each day. You can jump to any section in the [table
of contents][#table-of-contents] below. Each section has the recommended
readings to be done before the session that day, as well as starter code for
that day for reference. Generally, you shouldn't replace the code you already
have with our starter code unless you miss a day of class. It is better for you
to get used to your own code.

## Getting Started

**If you know nothing about git or GitHub**, or maybe you just aren't very
confident with them, then don't worry. We will learn some of the basics later in
this training, but for now, you can just download [the starter code for day
1][day1] as a .zip file with the green download button in the top right.

**If you are already familiar with git and GitHub**, you should have no problem
getting started. Just clone this repository and switch to [the day-1
branch][day1]. We recommend that you then split off a new branch from there,
just in case you want to refer back to day 1 at some point, but that is up to
you.

### Required Tools

You should try to install all of these before the first day of training. If you
have trouble getting any of them working, you can get help on the first day.

* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) lets us use code published by
  other people.
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) allows us to run our code
  on any system we need to.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), or if you
  already have a favorite code editor, you can use that instead.
